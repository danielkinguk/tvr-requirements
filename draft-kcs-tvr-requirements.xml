      <t>Time-Variant Routing (TVR) refers to the calculation of a path or subpath through a network where the time of message transmission (or receipt) is part of the overall route computation. This means that, all things being equal, a TVR computation might produce different results depending on the time that the computation is performed without other detectable changes to the network topology or other cost functions associated with the route.</t>
      <t>This document introduces requirements where TVR computations could improve message exchange in a network.</t>

      <name>Overview of Time-Variant Networks</name>
      <t>Existing Internet routing techniques maintain end-to-end connected paths across a network. Routing mechanisms exist to recover
         connectivity and resume normal traffic forwarding as the topology changes. Occasionally, optimisation of routes may also be
         requested, especially post-topology changes due to disruptive events. However, there are a growing number of use cases where
         changes to the routing topology are an expected part of network operations. In these scenarios, the pre-planned loss and
         restoration of an adjacency, or formation of an alternate adjacency, should be seen as a non-disruptive event.</t>

      <t>Time-Variant Routing (TVR) refers to calculating a path or subpath through a network where the time of message transmission
         (or receipt) is part of the overall route computation.  Therefore, a TVR computation might produce different results
         depending on the time that the calculation is performed without other detectable changes to the network topology or other
         cost functions associated with the route.</t>

      <section anchor="scheduling">
        <name>Resource Scheduling</name>
        <t>Planned resource scheduling will be required for various scenarios; these include networks with mobile nodes, such as
           crewless aerial vehicles and orbiting satellite constellations <xref target="I-D.ietf-tvr-use-cases"/>. In these scenarios, links are lost and re-established
           as a function of the mobility of the platforms. Furthermore, link activity might be restricted to certain times of the
           day in networks without reliable access to power, such as networks harvesting energy from tidal, wind, and solar
           resources. Similarly, network traffic might be planned around energy costs or expected user data volumes in networks
           prioritising green computing and energy efficiency over data rate.</t>
        <section>
          <name>Schedule Visibility</name>
          <t>
Because scheduled time-variance is not a part of exsting routing algorithms and managed data models, not all routing applications will be made to handle schedules as part of the routing parameters intrinsically.
Two extremes of schedules being associated to routing data are:
          </t>
          <dl>
            <dt>Intrinsic Schedule:</dt>
            <dd>
In this situation the schedule is an intrinsic part of the managed data model which is visible to the routing application and used as part of the routing algorithms.
When the schedule is intrinsic, there is not necessarily the notion of a schedule being "executed" in wall-clock time because the time-varying parameters are ingested as part of the routing algorithms natural functioning.
            </dd>
            <dt>Extrinsic Schedule:</dt>
            <dd>
In this situation the schedule is not part of the managed data proper but maintained within the Orchestrator; the routing application only sees the effects of changes in routing parameters as the schedule is executed (in wall-clock time) by the Agent.
            </dd>
          </dl>
          <t>
There is also the possibility of an intermediate situation where the schedule is still part of the managed data model but is visible only to, and executed in wall-clock time by, the management Agent.
This allows a more distributed use of scheduled data than centralizing its processing in an Orchestrator.
          </t>
        </section>
        <section>
          <name>Schedule Locality</name>
          <t>
Similar to how different entities can have, or not have, visbility into a time-varying schedule there is also the aspect of where the schedule data is handled within the network topology.
Two extremes for locality of schedule handling are:
          </t>
          <dl>
            <dt>Centralized:</dt>
            <dd>
In this situation, all schedule handling is centralized within a network Orchestrator and changes are sent to routing applications in wall-clock time via a management interface.
This corresponds with the Extrinsic schedule visibility because the managed routers do not see the schedule to indicate why parameter changes are taking place.
            </dd>
            <dt>Distributed:</dt>
            <dd>
This situation corresponds with the Intrinsic or intermediate schedule visibility, where a schedule (with a potentially limited time horizon from what is known at the orchestrator) is part of the managed data which is distributed to managed devices to be handled either by the Agent or by the routing Application itself.
            </dd>
          </dl>
        </section>
      </section>
      <section>
        <name>General Temporality</name>
        <t>
This section covers different aspects of how temporality applies to any potential TVR information model.
Each aspect is roughly independent and informs how a model can choose to include temporality in its parameter space.
        </t>
        <section anchor="time-scope">
          <name>Scope of Time-Variability</name>
          <t>
One aspect of any time-varying model is the scope of what may be time-variable.
Two extremes of this aspect are:
          </t>
          <ul>
            <li>A model which is completely time-invariant, which while there is still a notion of time it has no affect on any of the model entities.</li>
            <li>A model in which every entity has some kind of schedule applied.</li>
          </ul>
          <t>
It is expected that an application of time-variability to real world data models will keep some entities within the model time-invariant and allow scheduling of other, specific entities.
          </t>
          <t>
Another aspect of any time-varying model is the granularity of state to which a schedule can be applied.
Two extremes of this aspect are:
          </t>
          <ul>
            <li>A model where one single schedule applies to the entire universe (<em>i.e.</em> indicating when the time-variant entities are valid or invalid).</li>
            <li>A model where every property of every entity can be scheduled independently. This is the temporality model of <xref target="AIXM"/>.</li>
          </ul>
          <t>
It is expected that an application of time-variability to data models will fit within these extremes, possibly applying a schedule to each entity indicating when that entity is valid or invalid, or applying a schedule to groups of properties within the entity (while leaving other properties time-invariant).
          </t>
        </section>
        <section>
          <name>Time Horizon</name>
          <t>
In an idealized model the schedules will apply indefinitely far in the past and the future, but in a realizable model with both processing and storage limitations there will need to be a time horizon within which the model applies and outside of which the model has no meaning.
In some cases this horizon will be intrinsic to the model itself, with an explicit model parameter indicating the horizon.
In other cases the model may allow indefinitely-large schedules but the processing of the planning timeline is bounded to limit resource needs.
          </t>
        </section>
        <section>
          <name>Time Precision</name>
          <t>
Different time-variant models will require different granularities of planning time, either because of limitations or assumptions about wall-clock time or because of requirements within the modeled domain.
It is up to specific models to define the precision of time values and the required accuracy and precison of wall-clocks which implement the schedules.
          </t>
        </section>
        <section>
          <name>Validity in a Schedule</name>
          <t>
Within a single schedule over the planning timeline there will likely be a need to have multiple discrete intervals of validity over absolute schedule time.
The time instants at which a schedule is invalid indicate an undefined property value, so it is important for a model to be able to accomodate multiple schedules as necessary to ensure that some properties can have values at all times.
          </t>
          <t>
A model which restricts itself to a single interval of validity could run into difficulties over a long enough time horizon and would need to resort to having multiple model entities represent the same modeled "thing" which can lead to confusion and inefficiency.
          </t>
        </section>
        <section>
          <name>Periodicity in a Schedule</name>
          <t>
Separate from the concept of intervals of validity in absolute schedule time, there can be a need to model repetitive states in a concise way.
One way to model a periodic change of state is to combine a set of absolute time intervals with a periodic parameterization (duration valid and duration invalid); this is the mdoel of <xref target="AIXM"/>.
          </t>
          <t>
A model which does not include the notion of periodicy within a schedule could be used in situations where discrete intervals of validity are needed to handle periodic state changes which is neither storage nor processing efficient.
          </t>
        </section>
        <section>
          <name>Continuity in a Schedule</name>
          <t>
A schedule which includes a sequence of time intervals needs to ensure that the interpretation of those intervals in the schedule timeline does not leave any "gaps" at the interval boundaries.
For that reason, it is important that the model uses half-open intervals of time so that time-adjacent intervals leave no gap.
In keeping with the terminology of <xref target="RFC3339"/>, intervals are bounded by their "start" and "end" instants.
It is <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> that any time-varying model use schedules with intervals closed on their start time and open on their end time.
This behavior lends to the interpretation, in the schedule timeline, that the scheduled state takes effect at an interval's start and continues until the subsequent state.
          </t>
        </section>
        <section>
          <name>Time-Overlap and Priority</name>
          <t>
In an ideal situation a model would be guaranteed by design to contain only contiguous and non-overlapping schedules for each time-variant scope.
In a realized model this kind of invaraint might not be enforcable or might lead to overly complex schedule structures.
One way a model can handle this is to establish a concept of schedule priority, where some intervals of the schedule timeline contain overlapping schedules for the same properties and only the highest-priority schedule applies.
When priorities are allowed by a model, it enables the concept of an "overlay" where a long-duration state can be temporarilly (in schedule time) superseded by a short-duration state.
          </t>
        </section>
        <section>
          <name>Property Value Interpolation</name>
          <t>
When a schedule is applied to an entity in a way which is more <xref target="time-scope">granular</xref> than just indicating when that whole entity is valid or invalid, the model needs to consider how individual properties are to be treated between scheduled instants.
Some of the possibile behaviors are:
          </t>
          <dl>
            <dt>Zero-order hold:</dt>
            <dd>
From the instant a scheduled value applies to a property until the subsequent-in-schedule-time value supersedes it.
This is simple from a logical standpoint, but discontinuties in the value over schedule time could cause issues with the model itself.
For some models, though, the constant values between change instants are actually beneficial by allowing the entire timeline to be compressed into a sequence of discrete state-change instants.
This is the behavior implied in models such as <xref target="AIXM"/>.
            </dd>
            <dt>Linear interpolation:</dt>
            <dd>
At the instants of time defined in the schedule the property takes the exact values, but between those instants the property is interpolated linearly over time.
This results in a state that is continuous over time, which is beneficial for some kinds of model but also means that there is no simple discrete sequence of states.
            </dd>
            <dt>Higher-order or spline interpolation:</dt>
            <dd>
Higher order interpolations can result in properties that vary over schedule time in ways that are more or less beneficial to different types of models.
            </dd>
          </dl>
          <t>
Regardless of the types of interpolation used, a model can choose to apply interpolation globally or per-property.
Since different properties represent different physical or logical metrics of a network it is expected that different types of interpolation will be needed for different represented quantities.
          </t>
        </section>
        <section>
          <name>Changes to Model State</name>
          <t>
Separate from how a time-variant model can contain a schedule timeline within the model state, a model design will need to consider how changes to the model state itself (over wall-clock time) are handled.
This aspect is actually not specific to a time-variant model but is important to consider in this context.
          </t>
          <t>
Two extremes of this aspect are:
          </t>
          <ul>
            <li>
A model which can only be changed wholesale, superseded by an entire new model state.
This is easy to keep consistent but has inefficiences of storage and transport if the model state is to be shared or exchanged between real entities.
            </li>
            <li>
A model which has an intrinsic notion of fine-grained superseding changes, possibly scoped to individual entities, individual schedules, or more complex groupings.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>
      </section>
      <section anchor="topologies">
        <name>Topologies</name>
        <t>
The primary entities of a topological network model, as realized in <xref target="RFC8345"/> and similar predecessors, are nodes and unidirectional links, with a secondary entity representing the "termination point" for each side of a link at a node.
Following the concepts described in <xref target="scheduling"/> these are the entities to which an intrinsic schedule can be applied.
        </t>
        <section anchor="nodes">
          <name>Nodes</name>
          <t>
When a schedule is applied to a node the granularity <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> at least be at the individual node.
In cases where the properties of a node have time-variable values the model <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> define an interpolation method, either globally or per-property.
          </t>
          <t>
A node is just a named entity in Layer 3 <xref target="RFC8346"/> and Layer 2 <xref target="RFC8944"/> topologies.
Schedules on a node <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> be used to indicate the validity of the entire node or changing properties of that entity.
When a schedule indicates that a node is not valid for a schedule time instant, that validity <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> apply to all of its termination points and links as well.
This logic allows a schedule to represent, for example, the expected power-on state of a node at a specific layer.
          </t>

        <section anchor="termpoints">

A termination point is associated with an IP address in Layer 3 <xref target="RFC8346"/> and a MAC address in Layer 2 <xref target="RFC8944"/> topologies.
Schedules on a termination point <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> be used to indicate the validity of the layer-2/3 interface represented by the entity or changing properties of that entity.
When a schedule indicates that a termination point is not valid for a schedule time instant, that validity <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> apply to all of its links as well.
This logic allows a schedule to represent, for example, the expected power-on or administrative-enabled state of an attached network interface card (NIC) or virtual private network (VPN) endpoint.

The effects of scheduled administrative disabling or enabling of an entity at one layer do not imply a change in administrative enabled state at any other layer.
Likewise, the assigning of an address property at one layer does not imply the presence or absence of an address assignment at that same time instant for any other layer.

        <t>Traditional network routing techniques typically use link bandwidth and delay for path calculation, and do not consider time-based factors. TVR should be
	   capable of improving network performance and reliability in environments where node livelyness and link availability is a time-based consideration, with various factors,
           including power availability, interface line of sight or expected demand. </t>
        <t>However, even if some adjacency failures are predictable, others are not, including link failures and node outages.
           Therefore, any new technique or routing protocol extension for TVR enviroments must be capable of handling planned and unexpected
           resource losses.</t>
	<t>Time-Variant Routing (TVR) introduces a scenario of calculating a path, or sub-path within a network, taking into account the timing
	   of message transmission or receipt as an integral part of the overall route computation.</t>
	<t>Furthermore, Synchronization of network time across TVR-capable nodes is critical in TVR networks.</t>
	<t>Three scenarios are currently considered when computating TVR-enabled paths.</t>
         <section anchor="Centralized">
         <name>Centralized</name>
         <t>The network nodes will receive the time variable information and traffic forwarding rules directly from a logically centralized source, such as a network controller. The time variable data may then be
	    processed locally by the node entered into the scheduled routing table and specific forwarding rules applied.</t>
         </section>
         <section anchor="Distributed">
         <name>Distributed</name>
         <t>All network nodes will participate in a routing scheme where time variable information is propagated through the network via capability and variability advertisements. This could be achieved using
            extensions to existing routing schemes and techniques so that link, adjacency, cost, and schedule may be considered when making forwarding decisions for per-hop packets or calculating traffic
            engineered end-to-end paths. It should be noted that schedule distribution and node computation latency may exist in some network environments.</t>

         <name>Hybrid</name>
         <t>In this scenario, mixed-node TVR capability exists. Some nodes will require a schedule provided by a centralized source, and others will be capable of advertising and learning scheduled information
	    via a distributed mechanism.</t>
	 <t>This scenario presents time and schedule synchronization and source verification challenges and will require further study.</t>

            <li>Distribution of Predicted Topology-change. The predicted topology-change information may include the valid time,
		invalid time, link costs at different times, and change periods. </li>

            <li>Topology Changes. The predicted topology-change information may change due to forecasted or unforecasted changes. The managing entity should be capable of providing a partial or full topology update as often as needed.</li>

            <li>The Minimum Route Recalculation Interval and Threshold. Although some cases may assume that the cost persists for a sufficient
		amount of time, considering that each route contains multiple links, the change frequency of the path may be much higher than
		the cost. In this case, the minimum recalculation interval or cost change threshold is needed to determine when a route
		recalculation is required. Of course, scheduled topology connection changes must be considered when path calculation is required.</li>

      <section title="Support the Identification and Advertisement of Node Property Changes">
        <t>In Time-Variant Routing, scheduling of the system are as expected.
        In practical situations, however, the properties of entities can be
        converted back and forth between Time-Variant and Non-Time-Variant
        nodes.</t>

        <t>A managed device MUST support the identification and advertisement of non-scheduled
        property changes.</t>

        <t>Besides, If there are abnormal changes in the system, it is
        necessary to advertise them through the existing routing protocols in
        time to achieve the stability of Time-Variant Routing and avoid
        redundant advertisements. For example, a node in the system is
        suddenly damaged due to external factors.
	Changes in a node's state outside of a schedule are communicated to other nodes in a network through existing routing protocol mechanims, where they exist.
	</t>

        <t>A manager SHOULD provide a advertisement methodology for responding to
        abnormal changes in the system.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Support Agent Node Advertisement">
        <t>Agent nodes can help to improve the efficiency of the network.
        There are some nodes in the network that do not have routing
        functions. When their properties change, they are unable to notify
        other nodes in the network. Agent nodes can help nodes without routing
        functions to advertise information, thus improving the efficiency of
        the network. Therefore,</t>

        <t>o MUST support agent nodes to help non-routing nodes implement
        information advertisement.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Support Identification and Classification of Node Properties">
        <t>The node properties of the network may change as described in 3.1.
        If the system cannot timely identify and classify in a processing
        manner after the node properties change, it will lead to suboptimal
        routing decisions. Therefore,</t>

        <t>o MUST provide a discovery and resolving methodology for the
        identification and classification of node properties.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Support System Schedule and Time Interval Changes">
        <t>The system's schedule may change, requiring of to be reconfigured
        instead it being set once and not being able to be modified.
        Additionally, time-variant intervals in the system may also vary.
        Therefore,</t>

        <t>o MUST support system schedule changes.</t>

        <t>o MUST support time interval changes.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Support Appropriate Time Accuracy">
        <t>The accuracy of the time cannot be too large or too small;
        otherwise, convergence may not be possible. Therefore,</t>

        <t>o MUST support appropriate time accuracy.</t>
