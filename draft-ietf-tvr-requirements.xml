    <abstract>
      <t>Time-Variant Routing (TVR) refers to calculating a path or subpath through a network where the time of message transmission
         (or receipt) is part of the overall route computation. This means that, all things being equal, a TVR computation might
         produce different results depending on the time that the computation is performed without other detectable changes to the
         network topology or other cost functions associated with the route.</t>

      <t>This document introduces requirements where TVR computations could improve message exchange in a network.</t>

This document is an informational specification meant to inform the design and implementation of systems which manage time-variant routing (TVR) information, and to allow characterizing those systems with aspects which are understandable to network operators.
The terms discussed in this document are intentionally general and are intended to be tailored for specifics of those individual TVR systems.
      </t>
      <t>
This document starts with an overview of TVR networks and aspects of their time variance in <xref target="overview"/> and elaborates on TVR use cases in <xref target="tvr-use-case-requirements"/>.
Requirements on the design of TVR systems are then categorized and summarized in <xref target="requirements-summary"/> with security considerations provided for those systems in <xref target="security-considerations"/>.

          <dd>A single attribute of an entity which is used to parameterize that entity. The notion of a property is not time-variant, the property always exists within an entity but its value may be time-variant.</dd>
          <dt>Property Value:</dt>
          <dd>The specific value of a property, both as a planned state within the schedule timeline and as a realized state in wall-clock time.</dd>

          <dt>Schedule Time:</dt>
          <dd>An idealized timeline within a time-variant model over which entities and property values may change without a difference of state in the model itself. The notion of schedule time is intrinsic to the model.</dd>
          <dt>Wall-Clock Time:</dt>
          <dd>The true timeline, measured in some time scale by some local ticker. The notion of wall-clock time is extrinsic to the model; even non-time-variant models allow for changes over wall-clock time, just as different model states rather than a change <em>within</em> the model itself.</dd>

    <section anchor="overview">
      <name>Overview of Time-Variant Networks</name>
      <t>Existing Internet routing techniques maintain end-to-end connected paths across a network. Routing mechanisms exist to recover
         connectivity and resume normal traffic forwarding as the topology changes. Occasionally, optimization of routes may also be
         requested, especially post-topology changes due to disruptive events. However, there are a growing number of use cases where
         changes to the routing topology are an expected part of network operations. In these scenarios, the pre-planned loss and
         restoration of an adjacency, or formation of an alternate adjacency, should be seen as a non-disruptive event.</t>

      <t>Time-Variant Routing (TVR) refers to calculating a path or subpath through a network where the time of message transmission
         (or receipt) is part of the overall route computation.  Therefore, a TVR computation might produce different results
         depending on the time a calculation is performed without other detectable changes to the network topology or other
         cost functions associated with the route.</t>

      <section anchor="scheduling">
        <name>Resource Scheduling</name>
        <t>Planned resource scheduling is essential for various scenarios, including networks with mobile entities such as unmanned
           aerial vehicles and orbiting satellite constellations <xref target="RFC9657"/>. In these scenarios, links are lost and re-established
           as a function of the mobility of the platforms. Furthermore, link activity might be restricted to certain times of the
           day in networks without reliable access to power, such as networks harvesting energy from tidal, wind, and solar
           resources. Similarly, network traffic might be planned around energy costs or expected user data volumes in networks
           prioritising green computing and energy efficiency over data rate.</t>
        <section anchor="schedule-visibility">
          <name>Schedule Visibility</name>
          <t>
Because scheduled time-variance is not a part of existing routing algorithms and managed data models, not all routing applications will be made to handle schedules as part of the routing parameters intrinsically.
          </t>
          <t>
Two extremes of schedules being associated with routing data are:
          </t>
          <dl>
            <dt>Intrinsic Schedule:</dt>
            <dd>
In this situation, the schedule is an intrinsic part of the managed data model which is visible to the routing application and used as part of the routing algorithms.
When the schedule is intrinsic, there is not necessarily the notion of a schedule being "executed" in wall-clock time because the time-varying parameters are ingested as part of the routing algorithms natural functioning.
            </dd>
            <dt>Extrinsic Schedule:</dt>
            <dd>
In this situation, the schedule is not part of the managed data proper but maintained within the Orchestrator; the routing application only sees the effects of changes in routing parameters as the schedule is executed (in wall-clock time) by the Agent.
            </dd>
          </dl>
          <t>
There is also the possibility of an intermediate situation where the schedule is still part of the managed data model but is visible only to, and executed in wall-clock time by, the management Agent.
This allows a more distributed use of scheduled data than centralizing its processing in an Orchestrator.
          </t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="schedule-gen-locality">
          <name>Generation Locality</name>
          <t>
The generation of a scheduled data model depends on collecting source data (which likely has some temporal information in it to begin with), choosing a time horizon to schedule within, and then processing the source data into an overall schedule.
          </t>
          <t>
Two extremes for locality of schedule generation are:
          </t>
          <dl>
            <dt>Centralized Generation:</dt>
            <dd>
              <t>
In this situation, all schedule generation is centralized within a network Orchestrator and changes are sent to routing applications in wall-clock time via a management interface.
Even though the generation of the schedule is centralized, both the schedule visibility (within the data model) and the locality of how the schedule is executed are unconstrained.
              </t>
              <t>
For example, a schedule could be generated in a central orchestrator synchronized to all managed devices which then execute the schedule in a distributed manner.
              </t>
            </dd>
            <dt>Distributed Generation:</dt>
            <dd>
This situation corresponds with the intrinsic or intermediate schedule visibility. Where a schedule (with a potentially limited time horizon from what is known at the orchestrator) is part of the managed data which is distributed to managed devices to be handled either by the Agent or by the routing Application itself.
            </dd>
          </dl>
        </section>
        <section anchor="schedule-exec-locality">
          <name>Execution Locality</name>
          <t>
Depending on the visibility of schedules within a data model (see <xref target="schedule-visibility"/>) there are different options for where the schedule may be executed, and ultimately influence a time-varying configuration on a managed device.
          </t>
          <t>
Two extremes for locality of schedule execution are:
          </t>
          <dl>
            <dt>Centralized Execution:</dt>
            <dd>
              <t>
In this situation, all schedule execution is centralized within a network Orchestrator and changes are sent to routing applications in wall-clock time via a management interface.
This situation can apply to any type of schedule visibility, but only to centralized generation because the full scheduled data model needs to be available to the entity performing the execution.
              </t>
            </dd>
            <dt>Distributed Execution:</dt>
            <dd>
              <t>
In this situation, schedules are executed on each managed device independently but based on synchronized clocks.
This situation corresponds with the Intrinsic or intermediate schedule visibility, where a schedule (with a potentially limited time horizon from what is known at the Orchestrator) is part of the managed data which is distributed to managed devices to be handled either by the Agent or by the routing Application itself.
              </t>
              <t>
When schedules are distributed to the managed devices, it necessarily increases the amount of data that the managing device needs to synchronize across the network.
The ratio of increased size can be mitigated by only distributing a limited time horizon to each device within a sliding window that moves forward in non-real-time.
              </t>
            </dd>
          </dl>
          <t>
When schedules are both generated and executed centrally, there is a consistency risk between different managed devices because if one device fails to be reconfigured in wall-clock time its configuration will no longer align with the other devices which are supposed to all operate on the same schedule.
To recover from this kind of situation, either reattempt to configure the misaligned device may be made to bring it back into alignment with the other devices or the other devices' configurations must be rolled-back into consistency which will then cause all the devices to be off-schedule.
          </t>
          <t>
When schedules are executed on each device, there is a risk that clocks on different devices become de-synchronized beyond the time precision required of the schedule.
Because real-time clocks are necessary for more than just schedule execution, and because accurate and precise time sources exist outside of network time (<em>e.g.</em>, GPS time) this risk can be made to have a low probability.
          </t>
          <t>
With distributed execution there is also a risk that a manager loses connectivity with the managed device and the device eventually runs out of time horizon in the schedule which is known to it.
This risk can be mitigated by trading between the size and the horizon end-time of schedules distributed to managed devices. This trade can be different for different devices, where some well-connected devices operate closer to just-in-time with short horizons while other devices can be given a longer horizon to allow it to execute in the absence of near-continuous manager connectivity.
          </t>
          <t>
One possible combination of these options is depicted in <xref target="fig-distrib-snapshot"/>, where inputs are collected in a centralized schedule generator, the schedule is executed on that centralized entity by taking a snapshot (periodically or as-needed when model state changes over schedule time) and distributing the time-invariant snapshot configuration.

An alternative combination is depicted in <xref target="fig-distrib-schedule"/>, where inputs are also collected in and a schedule generated by a centralized entity, but in this alternative the scheduled model (or some filtered time horizon of it) is distributed to the managed devices to be executed independently on each device.

          <name>Configuration and Operational State</name>
          <t>
Most of the discussion in this document treats scheduling as the means for influencing when configuration on some managed device is planned to be updated.
But as explained in <xref target="X.731"/> devices are expected to have an operational state alongside many administrative states.
For example, a known delay between enabling the modem supporting a termination point or link and the modem actually being usable for sending traffic.
          </t>
          <t>
Strategies for modeling time margins around changes of configuration are discussed in <xref target="time-sync"/>.
Even when time margins are taken into account, the schedules are still being applied to cascading subsequent changes of administrative state within configurations and have no immediate or direct relationship to (expected) subsequent changes in operational state.
          </t>

      <section>
        <name>General Temporality</name>
        <t>
This section covers different aspects of how temporality applies to any potential TVR information model.
Each aspect is roughly independent and informs how a model can choose to include temporality in its parameter space.
        </t>
        <section anchor="time-scope">
          <name>Scope of Time-Variability</name>
          <t>
One aspect of any time-varying model is the scope of what may be time-variable.
Two extremes of this aspect are:
          </t>
          <ul>
            <li>A model that is entirely time-invariant, where time exists conceptually but has no impact on any of the model's entities.</li>
            <li>A model in which every entity has some kind of schedule applied.</li>
          </ul>
          <t>
It is expected that an application of time-variability to real world data models will keep some entities within the model time-invariant and allow scheduling of other, specific entities.
          </t>
          <t>
Another aspect of any time-varying model is the granularity of state to which a schedule can be applied.
Two extremes of this aspect are:
          </t>
          <ul>
            <li>A model where one single schedule applies to the entire universe (<em>i.e.</em> indicating when the time-variant entities are valid or invalid).</li>
            <li>A model where every property of every entity can be scheduled independently. This is the temporality model of <xref target="AIXM"/>.</li>
          </ul>
          <t>
It is expected that the use of time-variability to data models will fit within these extremes, possibly applying a schedule to each entity indicating when that entity is valid or invalid, or applying a schedule to groups of properties within the entity (while leaving other properties time-invariant).
          </t>
        </section>
        <section>
          <name>Time Horizon</name>
          <t>
In an idealized model the schedules will apply indefinitely far in the past and the future, but in a realizable model with both processing and storage limitations there will need to be a time horizon within which the model applies and outside of which the model has no meaning.
In some cases this horizon will be intrinsic to the model itself, with an explicit model parameter indicating the horizon.
In other cases the model may allow indefinitely-large schedules but the processing of the schedule timeline is bounded to limit resource needs.
          </t>
        </section>
        <section>
          <name>Time Precision</name>
          <t>
Different time-variant models will require different granularities of planning time, either because of limitations or assumptions about wall-clock time or because of requirements within the modeled domain.
It is up to specific models to define the precision of time values and the required accuracy and precision of wall-clocks which execute the schedules.
          </t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="time-sync">
          <name>Time Synchronization and Margin</name>
          <t>
Any schedule execution and device configuration (see locality options in <xref target="schedule-exec-locality"/>) will necessarily have some misalignment in the synchronization of time across all devices operating in the same timeline.
This misalignment is hopefully bounded by design and able to be characterized statistically.
          </t>
          <t>
It is important for the activity of schedule generation (see <xref target="schedule-gen-locality"/>) to take the misalignment into account as some form of margin around the instants of scheduled change.
The exact form that this margin would take depends on the specific time-varying properties.
          </t>
          <t>
Another source of time margin in a time-varying system can be due to a desire to model the time delay between changing the administrative state of some subsystem and a subsequent change to its operational state as a consequence.
          </t>
          <t>
Regardless of the reason for a schedule margin being accounted for, it is critical that the margin is not double-counted by different activities in the schedule processing chain.
          </t>
        </section>
        <section>
          <name>Validity in a Schedule</name>
          <t>
Within a single schedule over its timeline there will likely be a need to have multiple discrete intervals of validity over absolute schedule time.
The time instants at which a schedule is invalid indicate an undefined property value, so it is important for a model to be able to accommodate multiple schedules as necessary to ensure that some properties can have values at all times.
          </t>
          <t>
A model which restricts itself to a single interval of validity could run into difficulties over a long enough time horizon and would need to resort to having multiple model entities represent the same modeled "thing" which can lead to confusion and inefficiency.

          <name>Periodicity in a Schedule</name>
          <t>
Separate from the concept of intervals of validity in absolute schedule time, there can be a need to model repetitive states in a concise way.
One way to model a periodic change of state is to combine a set of absolute time intervals with a periodic parameterization (duration valid and duration invalid); this is the model of <xref target="AIXM"/>.
          </t>
          <t>
A model which does not include the notion of periodicity within a schedule could be used in situations where discrete intervals of validity are needed to handle periodic state changes which is neither storage nor processing efficient.
Periodicity can also be seen as unnecessary when the time horizon will always be small enough compared to any schedule time period that only one repetition is ever seen within the horizon in one state.

        <section>
          <name>Continuity in a Schedule</name>
          <t>
A schedule which includes a sequence of time intervals needs to ensure that the interpretation of those intervals in the schedule timeline does not leave any "gaps" at the interval boundaries.
For that reason, it is important that the model uses half-open intervals of time so that time-adjacent intervals leave no gap.
In keeping with the terminology of <xref target="RFC3339"/>, intervals are bounded by their "start" and "end" instants.
It is suggested that any time-varying model use schedules with intervals closed on their start time and open on their end time.
This behavior lends to the interpretation, in the schedule timeline, that the scheduled state takes effect at an interval's start and continues until the subsequent state.

        </section>
        <section>
          <name>Time-Overlap and Priority</name>
          <t>
In an ideal situation a model would be guaranteed by design to contain only contiguous and non-overlapping schedules for each time-variant scope.
In a realized model this kind of invariant might not be enforceable or might lead to overly complex schedule structures.
One way a model can handle this is to establish a concept of schedule priority, where some intervals of the schedule timeline contain overlapping schedules for the same properties and only the highest-priority schedule applies.
When priorities are allowed by a model, it enables the concept of an "overlay" where a long-duration state can be temporarily (in schedule time) superseded by a short-duration state.

          <name>Property Value Interpolation</name>
          <t>
When a schedule is applied to an entity in a way which is more <xref target="time-scope">granular</xref> than just indicating when that whole entity is valid or invalid, the model needs to consider how individual properties are to be treated between scheduled instants.
Some of the possible behaviors are:
          </t>
          <dl>
            <dt>Zero-order hold:</dt>
            <dd>
From the instant a scheduled value applies to a property until the subsequent-in-schedule-time value supersedes it.
This is simple from a logical standpoint, but discontinuities in the value over schedule time could cause issues with the model itself.
For some models, though, the constant values between change instants are actually beneficial by allowing the entire timeline to be compressed into a sequence of discrete state-change instants.
This is the behavior implied in models such as <xref target="AIXM"/>.
            </dd>
            <dt>Linear interpolation:</dt>
            <dd>
At the instants of time defined in the schedule the property takes the exact values, but between those instants the property is interpolated linearly over time.
This results in a state that is continuous over time, which is beneficial for some kinds of model but also means that there is no simple discrete sequence of states.
            </dd>
            <dt>Higher-order or spline interpolation:</dt>
            <dd>
Higher order interpolations can result in properties that vary over schedule time in ways that are more or less beneficial to different types of models.
            </dd>
          </dl>
          <t>
Regardless of the types of interpolation used, a model can choose to apply interpolation globally or per-property.
Since different properties represent different physical or logical metrics of a network it is expected that different types of interpolation will be needed for different represented quantities.

          <name>Changes to Model State</name>
          <t>
Separate from how a time-variant model can contain a schedule timeline within the model state, a model design will need to consider how changes to the model state itself (over wall-clock time) are handled.
This aspect is actually not specific to a time-variant model but is important to consider in this context.
          </t>
          <t>
Two extremes of this aspect are:
          </t>
          <ul>
            <li>
A model which can only be changed wholesale, superseded by an entire new model state.
This is easy to keep consistent but has inefficiencies of storage and transport if the model state is to be shared or exchanged between real entities.
            </li>
            <li>
A model which has an intrinsic notion of fine-grained superseding changes, possibly scoped to individual entities, individual schedules, or more complex groupings.

When a schedule is applied to a node the granularity could at least be at the individual node.

A node is just a named entity in Layer 3 <xref target="RFC8346"/> and Layer 2 <xref target="RFC8944"/> topologies.

When a schedule indicates that a termination point is not valid for a schedule time instant, that validity may apply to all of its links as well.

The effects of scheduled administrative disabling or enabling of an entity at one layer do not imply a change in administrative enabled state at any other layer.
Likewise, the assigning of an address property at one layer does not imply the presence or absence of an address assignment at that same time instant for any other layer.

           including power availability, interface line of sight or expected demand. </t>
        <t>However, even if some adjacency failures are predictable, others are not, including link failures and entity outages.

              <t>Furthermore, a centralized approach could also be used to extend existing tunnel and path delivery mechanisms and protocols to distribute traffic forwarding rules along with time-variable information. However, in certain environments, a logically centralized source may lose connectivity with network entities (as described in <xref target="schedule-exec-locality"/>), preventing timely delivery of traffic forwarding rules. To mitigate this risk, the time horizon for time-variable information should be extended accordingly.</t>

       data and can vary significantly depending on multiple factors. By considering time-variant constraints, network operators can enhance the efficiency, reliability, and performance of telecom networks. The main
       factors influencing these constraints include:</t>

         <ol spacing="normal" type="1">
            <li>Predicted Traffic Demand: Network usage patterns fluctuate throughout the day, with peak times typically occurring during
      business hours and in the evening. Predicting these patterns accurately allows for proactive resource allocation, ensuring that
      sufficient bandwidth is available during high-demand periods without over-provisioning during low-demand times.</li>

            <li>Energy Efficiency: The energy consumption of network equipment can be optimized based on the current load. By scheduling resources and
      adjusting power levels or shutting down underutilized equipment, telecom networks can significantly reduce energy costs and carbon
      footprints, contributing to sustainability goals.</li>

            <li>Weather Conditions: Weather can impact network performance, especially for wireless and satellite communications. Adverse
      weather conditions such as heavy rain, snow, or extreme temperatures can degrade signal quality. Incorporating predicted and real-time weather
      data into network management strategies can help in adjusting transmission power, rerouting traffic, or preemptively switching to
      more resilient pathways.</li>

            <li>Network Maintenance and Upgrades: Scheduled maintenance or unexpected faults can introduce temporary constraints. By planning
      maintenance activities during off-peak hours and having real-time monitoring systems to quickly detect and address faults, network
      downtime can be minimized.</li>

         <t>Time-variant network relies on accurate and timely dissemination of time-variant routing and forwarding information. However, the presence of

            manipulate scheduled routing updates to introduce black holes, persistent loops, or denial-of-service conditions by injecting false time-sensitive
            state changes. Even in non-malicious scenarios, incorrect or misaligned scheduling or misconfiguration, or time de-synchronization, may lead to
            unintended forwarding behavior, potentially degrading performance or causing service disruptions.</t>

         <t>To mitigate these risks, TVR solution mechanisms should incorporate integrity validation and trust enforcement to ensure the correctness and
            authenticity of time-sensitive routing updates. This may include cryptographic techniques to verify the source and integrity of schedule updates,
            consistency checks against expected network state, and mechanisms to detect and reject anomalous scheduling data. Additionally, fallback strategies

      <section title="Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attack">

           <t>Precisely coordinating time information across devices and routers is critical to
              maintaining network stability. Malicious actors could exploit this dependency by disrupting or manipulating the time
              synchronization process. For example, an attacker could intentionally delay or corrupt time signals exchanged within
              the network, leading to routing errors and widespread denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. In this scenario, routers and
              managed devices may fail to correctly determine the optimal paths, resulting in dropped packets, increased latency,
              or even complete service outages. Additionally, these attacks could be scaled to affect multiple devices simultaneously,

              mechanisms, such as Network Time Protocol (NTP) or Precision Time Protocol (PTP), is essential to mitigate these risks.</t>

           <t>Time variant networks may involve frequent updates and adjustments to routing tables
              based on current and forecasted network conditions. If time information is not adequately protected, attackers could
              conduct traffic analysis to infer routing decisions, network load, or usage patterns. The schedule ability could enable
              attackers to launch highly targeted attacks, such as selectively overloading certain links or intercepting sensitive
              communications. Moreover, long-term analysis of time-variant network data could provide attackers with insights into the

              time scheduling decisions could be analyzed to determine when and where certain devices are active, allowing an attacker to
              infer user habits, locations, or preferences. This could pose significant privacy concerns, particularly in environments

              malicious activities.</t>

       <section title="Spoofing and Manipulation of Time Information">

          <t>The accuracy and integrity of time information are crucial for making correct
              routing decisions. If an attacker were to inject false or manipulated time data into the network, it could cause routers and
              devices to make incorrect decisions, potentially leading to traffic misrouting, network partitions, or inefficient use of
              resources. Such spoofing attacks could divert traffic through malicious nodes, enabling man-in-the-middle attacks, data
              interception, or unauthorized access to network resources. Furthermore, time manipulation could create persistent disruptions
              by continuously altering the perceived time, thereby forcing the network into a constant state of flux and instability.
              Robust authentication mechanisms for time sources and integrity checks on time-related messages are essential to defend against
              these types of attacks. Moreover, implementing redundancy in time synchronization (e.g., multiple time sources) can provide

              where a malicious actor intercepts and retransmits valid time-based data at a later time. This could cause network devices to
              act on outdated information, leading to inconsistent routing decisions, misaligned schedules, or security gaps.
              In particular, attackers could exploit replay attacks to force devices into outdated configurations or interfere with the
              synchronization of schedules across the network. To prevent this type of attack, it is important to use a messaging protocol for
              time-variant schedules that mitigates such attacks while ensuring the validity and timeliness of received information.</t>

       <section title="Compromised Time Sources">

          <t>Compromised Time Sources: The reliance on external time sources for synchronization purposes presents a potential attack surface
              for time-variant networks. If a trusted time source, such as a GPS signal or an NTP server, is compromised, the attacker could
              feed erroneous time information to the entire network, disrupting its operation. Such an attack could lead to cascading failures
              as devices attempt to synchronize with the compromised source, ultimately resulting in incorrect routing decisions or even the
              collapse of the network. To address this, network operators should implement multiple, redundant time sources and regularly
              verify the integrity of these sources. In addition, alerting mechanisms should be in place to detect significant deviations in
              time data that could indicate an attack.</t>
