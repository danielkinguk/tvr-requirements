                TVR (Time-Variant Routing) Requirements
                   draft-ietf-tvr-requirements-latest

Abstract

   Time-Variant Routing (TVR) refers to calculating a path or subpath
   through a network where the time of message transmission (or receipt)
   is part of the overall route computation.  This means that, all
   things being equal, a TVR computation might produce different results
   depending on the time that the computation is performed without other
   detectable changes to the network topology or other cost functions
   associated with the route.

   This document introduces requirements where TVR computations could
   improve message exchange in a network.

1.  Introduction

   This document is an informational specification meant to inform the
   design and implentation of systems which manage time-variant routing
   (TVR) information, and to allow characterizing those systems with
   aspects which are understandable to network operators.  The terms
   discussed in this document are intentionally general and are intended
   to be tailored for specifics of those individual TVR systems.

   This document starts with an overview of TVR networks and aspects of
   their time variance in Section 2 and elaborates on TVR use cases in
   Section 3.  Requirements on the design of TVR systems are then
   categorized and summarized in Section 4 with security considerations
   provided for those systems in Section 5.

1.1.  Conventions and Definitions

   Specific terms used within this document are as follows:

   Model:  The universe being modeled, which defines a parameter space.

   Entity:  A single separable item within the model.  Each entity has a
      stable identity which is time-invariant.

   Property:  A single attribute of an entity which is used to
      parameterize that entity.  The notion of a property is not time-
      variant, the property always exists within an entity but its value
      may be time-variant.

   Property Value:  The specific value of a property, both as a planned
      state within the schedule timeline and as a realized state in
      wall-clock time.

   Schedule:  The method of parameterizing time-variance intrinsic to a
      time-variant model.  The parameters of a schedule are within the
      state space of the model.

   Schedule Time:  An idealized timeline within a time-variant model
      over which entities and property values may change without a
      difference of state in the model itself.  The notion of schedule
      time is intrinsic to the model.

   Wall-Clock Time:  The true timeline, measured in some time scale by
      some local ticker.  The notion of wall-clock time is extrinsic to
      the model; even non-time-variant models allow for changes over
      wall-clock time, just as different model states rather than a
      change _within_ the model itself.

   Time Instant:  A single instant of time, consistent with the concepts
      of date-time in [RFC3339].

   Timeline:  A possibly bounded interval of time, consistent with the
      concept of a period in [RFC3339].

   Subsequent:  A time instant which is later in a timeline than some
      reference time instant.

   Orchestrator:  The subsystem of a managing device which centralizes
      control of a network and applies policy to manage a network.  A
      Path Computation Element (PCE) [RFC4655] is an example of an
      Orchestrator.

   Manager:  The subsystem in a managing device which operates a
      management protocol to control an Agent.

   Agent:  The subsystem in a managed device which operates a management
      protocol to be controlled by a Manager.

   (Routing) Application:  The subsystem of a managed device which
      performs the functions of a routing protocol and/or algorithm.

2.  Overview of Time-Variant Networks

   Existing Internet routing techniques maintain end-to-end connected
   paths across a network.  Routing mechanisms exist to recover
   connectivity and resume normal traffic forwarding as the topology
   changes.  Occasionally, optimization of routes may also be requested,
   especially post-topology changes due to disruptive events.  However,
   there are a growing number of use cases where changes to the routing
   topology are an expected part of network operations.  In these
   scenarios, the pre-planned loss and restoration of an adjacency, or
   formation of an alternate adjacency, should be seen as a non-
   disruptive event.

   Time-Variant Routing (TVR) refers to calculating a path or subpath
   through a network where the time of message transmission (or receipt)
   is part of the overall route computation.  Therefore, a TVR
   computation might produce different results depending on the time a
   calculation is performed without other detectable changes to the
   network topology or other cost functions associated with the route.

2.1.  Resource Scheduling

   Planned resource scheduling is essential for various scenarios,
   including networks with mobile entities such as unmanned aerial
   vehicles and orbiting satellite constellations [RFC9657].  In these
   scenarios, links are lost and re-established as a function of the
   mobility of the platforms.  Furthermore, link activity might be
   restricted to certain times of the day in networks without reliable
   access to power, such as networks harvesting energy from tidal, wind,
   and solar resources.  Similarly, network traffic might be planned
   around energy costs or expected user data volumes in networks
   prioritising green computing and energy efficiency over data rate.

2.1.1.  Schedule Visibility

   Because scheduled time-variance is not a part of existing routing
   algorithms and managed data models, not all routing applications will
   be made to handle schedules as part of the routing parameters
   intrinsically.

   Two extremes of schedules being associated with routing data are:

   Intrinsic Schedule:  In this situation, the schedule is an intrinsic
      part of the managed data model which is visible to the routing
      application and used as part of the routing algorithms.  When the
      schedule is intrinsic, there is not necessarily the notion of a
      schedule being "executed" in wall-clock time because the time-
      varying parameters are ingested as part of the routing algorithms
      natural functioning.

   Extrinsic Schedule:  In this situation, the schedule is not part of
      the managed data proper but maintained within the Orchestrator;
      the routing application only sees the effects of changes in
      routing parameters as the schedule is executed (in wall-clock
      time) by the Agent.

   There is also the possibility of an intermediate situation where the
   schedule is still part of the managed data model but is visible only
   to, and executed in wall-clock time by, the management Agent.  This
   allows a more distributed use of scheduled data than centralizing its
   processing in an Orchestrator.

2.1.2.  Generation Locality

   The generation of a scheduled data model depends on collecting source
   data (which likely has some temporal information in it to begin
   with), choosing a time horizon to schedule within, and then
   processing the source data into an overall schedule.

   Two extremes for locality of schedule generation are:

   Centralized Generation:  In this situation, all schedule generation
      is centralized within a network Orchestrator and changes are sent
      to routing applications in wall-clock time via a management
      interface.  Even though the generation of the schedule is
      centralized, both the schedule visibility (within the data model)
      and the locality of how the schedule is executed are
      unconstrained.

      For example, a schedule could be generated in a central
      orchestrator synchronized to all managed devices which then
      execute the schedule in a distributed manner.

   Distributed Generation:  This situation corresponds with the
      intrinsic or intermediate schedule visibility.  Where a schedule
      (with a potentially limited time horizon from what is known at the
      orchestrator) is part of the managed data which is distributed to
      managed devices to be handled either by the Agent or by the
      routing Application itself.

2.1.3.  Execution Locality

   Depending on the visibility of schedules within a data model (see
   Section 2.1.1) there are different options for where the schedule may
   be executed, and ultimately influence a time-varying configuration on
   a managed device.

   Two extremes for locality of schedule execution are:

   Centralized Execution:  In this situation, all schedule execution is
      centralized within a network Orchestrator and changes are sent to
      routing applications in wall-clock time via a management
      interface.  This situation can apply to any type of schedule
      visibility, but only to centralized generation because the full
      scheduled data model needs to be available to the entity
      performing the execution.

   Distributed Execution:  In this situation, schedules are executed on
      each managed device independently but based on synchronized
      clocks.  This situation corresponds with the Intrinsic or
      intermediate schedule visibility, where a schedule (with a
      potentially limited time horizon from what is known at the
      Orchestrator) is part of the managed data which is distributed to
      managed devices to be handled either by the Agent or by the
      routing Application itself.

      When schedules are distributed to the managed devices, it
      necessarily increases the amount of data that the managing device
      needs to synchronize across the network.  The ratio of increased
      size can be mitigated by only distributing a limited time horizon
      to each device within a sliding window that moves forward in non-
      real-time.

   When schedules are both generated and executed centrally, there is a
   consistency risk between different managed devices because if one
   device fails to be reconfigured in wall-clock time its configuration
   will no longer align with the other devices which are supposed to all
   operate on the same schedule.  To recover from this kind of
   situation, either reattempt to configure the misaligned device may be
   made to bring it back into alignment with the other devices or the
   other devices' configurations must be rolled-back into consistency
   which will then cause all the devices to be off-schedule.

   When schedules are executed on each device, there is a risk that
   clocks on different devices become desynchronized beyond the time
   precision required of the schedule.  Because real-time clocks are
   necessary for more than just schedule execution, and because accurate
   and precise time sources exist outside of network time (_e.g._, GPS
   time) this risk can be made to have a low probability.

   With distributed execution there is also a risk that a manager loses
   connectivity with the managed device and the device eventually runs
   out of time horizon in the schedule which is known to it.  This risk
   can be mitigated by trading between the size and the horizon end-time
   of schedules distributed to managed devices.  This trade can be
   different for different devices, where some well-connected devices
   operate closer to just-in-time with short horizons while other
   devices can be given a longer horizon to allow it to execute in the
   absence of near-continuous manager connectivity.

2.2.  General Temporality

   This section covers different aspects of how temporality applies to
   any potential TVR information model.  Each aspect is roughly
   independent and informs how a model can choose to include temporality
   in its parameter space.

2.2.1.  Scope of Time-Variability

   One aspect of any time-varying model is the scope of what may be
   time-variable.  Two extremes of this aspect are:

   *  A model that is entirely time-invariant, where time exists
      conceptually but has no impact on any of the model's entities.

   *  A model in which every entity has some kind of schedule applied.

   It is expected that an application of time-variability to real world
   data models will keep some entities within the model time-invariant
   and allow scheduling of other, specific entities.

   Another aspect of any time-varying model is the granularity of state
   to which a schedule can be applied.  Two extremes of this aspect are:

   *  A model where one single schedule applies to the entire universe
      (_i.e._ indicating when the time-variant entities are valid or
      invalid).

   *  A model where every property of every entity can be scheduled
      independently.  This is the temporality model of [AIXM].

   It is expected that the use of time-variability to data models will
   fit within these extremes, possibly applying a schedule to each
   entity indicating when that entity is valid or invalid, or applying a
   schedule to groups of properties within the entity (while leaving
   other properties time-invariant).

2.2.2.  Time Horizon

   In an idealized model the schedules will apply indefinitely far in
   the past and the future, but in a realizable model with both
   processing and storage limitations there will need to be a time
   horizon within which the model applies and outside of which the model
   has no meaning.  In some cases this horizon will be intrinsic to the
   model itself, with an explicit model parameter indicating the
   horizon.  In other cases the model may allow indefinitely-large
   schedules but the processing of the planning timeline is bounded to
   limit resource needs.

2.2.3.  Time Precision

   Different time-variant models will require different granularities of
   planning time, either because of limitations or assumptions about
   wall-clock time or because of requirements within the modeled domain.
   It is up to specific models to define the precision of time values
   and the required accuracy and precision of wall-clocks which execute
   the schedules.

2.2.4.  Validity in a Schedule

   Within a single schedule over the planning timeline there will likely
   be a need to have multiple discrete intervals of validity over
   absolute schedule time.  The time instants at which a schedule is
   invalid indicate an undefined property value, so it is important for
   a model to be able to accommodate multiple schedules as necessary to
   ensure that some properties can have values at all times.

   A model which restricts itself to a single interval of validity could
   run into difficulties over a long enough time horizon and would need
   to resort to having multiple model entities represent the same
   modeled "thing" which can lead to confusion and inefficiency.

2.2.5.  Periodicity in a Schedule

   Separate from the concept of intervals of validity in absolute
   schedule time, there can be a need to model repetitive states in a
   concise way.  One way to model a periodic change of state is to
   combine a set of absolute time intervals with a periodic
   parameterization (duration valid and duration invalid); this is the
   mdoel of [AIXM].

   A model which does not include the notion of periodicity within a
   schedule could be used in situations where discrete intervals of
   validity are needed to handle periodic state changes which is neither
   storage nor processing efficient.

2.2.6.  Continuity in a Schedule

   A schedule which includes a sequence of time intervals needs to
   ensure that the interpretation of those intervals in the schedule
   timeline does not leave any "gaps" at the interval boundaries.  For
   that reason, it is important that the model uses half-open intervals
   of time so that time-adjacent intervals leave no gap.  In keeping
   with the terminology of [RFC3339], intervals are bounded by their
   "start" and "end" instants.  It is suggested that any time-varying
   model use schedules with intervals closed on their start time and
   open on their end time.  This behavior lends to the interpretation,
   in the schedule timeline, that the scheduled state takes effect at an
   interval's start and continues until the subsequent state.

2.2.7.  Time-Overlap and Priority

   In an ideal situation a model would be guaranteed by design to
   contain only contiguous and non-overlapping schedules for each time-
   variant scope.  In a realized model this kind of invariant might not
   be enforceable or might lead to overly complex schedule structures.
   One way a model can handle this is to establish a concept of schedule
   priority, where some intervals of the schedule timeline contain
   overlapping schedules for the same properties and only the highest-
   priority schedule applies.  When priorities are allowed by a model,
   it enables the concept of an "overlay" where a long-duration state
   can be temporarily (in schedule time) superseded by a short-duration
   state.

2.2.8.  Property Value Interpolation

   When a schedule is applied to an entity in a way which is more
   granular (Section 2.2.1) than just indicating when that whole entity
   is valid or invalid, the model needs to consider how individual
   properties are to be treated between scheduled instants.  Some of the
   possible behaviors are:

   Zero-order hold:  From the instant a scheduled value applies to a
      property until the subsequent-in-schedule-time value supersedes
      it.  This is simple from a logical standpoint, but discontinuities
      in the value over schedule time could cause issues with the model
      itself.  For some models, though, the constant values between
      change instants are actually beneficial by allowing the entire
      timeline to be compressed into a sequence of discrete state-change
      instants.  This is the behavior implied in models such as [AIXM].

   Linear interpolation:  At the instants of time defined in the
      schedule the property takes the exact values, but between those
      instants the property is interpolated linearly over time.  This
      results in a state that is continuous over time, which is
      beneficial for some kinds of model but also means that there is no
      simple discrete sequence of states.

   Higher-order or spline interpolation:  Higher order interpolations
      can result in properties that vary over schedule time in ways that
      are more or less beneficial to different types of models.

   Regardless of the types of interpolation used, a model can choose to
   apply interpolation globally or per-property.  Since different
   properties represent different physical or logical metrics of a
   network it is expected that different types of interpolation will be
   needed for different represented quantities.

2.2.9.  Changes to Model State

   Separate from how a time-variant model can contain a schedule
   timeline within the model state, a model design will need to consider
   how changes to the model state itself (over wall-clock time) are
   handled.  This aspect is actually not specific to a time-variant
   model but is important to consider in this context.

   Two extremes of this aspect are:

   *  A model which can only be changed wholesale, superseded by an
      entire new model state.  This is easy to keep consistent but has
      inefficiencies of storage and transport if the model state is to
      be shared or exchanged between real entities.

   *  A model which has an intrinsic notion of fine-grained superseding
      changes, possibly scoped to individual entities, individual
      schedules, or more complex groupings.

2.3.  Topologies

   The primary entities of a topological network model, as realized in
   [RFC8345] and similar predecessors, are nodes and unidirectional
   links, with a secondary entity representing the "termination point"
   for each side of a link at a node.  Following the concepts described
   in Section 2.1 these are the entities to which an intrinsic schedule
   can be applied.

2.3.1.  Nodes

   When a schedule is applied to a node the granularity could at least
   be at the individual node.  In cases where the properties of a node
   have time-variable values the model may define an interpolation
   method, either globally or per-property.

   A node is just a named entity in Layer 3 [RFC8346] and Layer 2
   [RFC8944] topologies.  Schedules on a node could be used to indicate
   the validity of the entire node or changing properties of that
   entity.  When a schedule indicates that a node is not valid for a
   schedule time instant, that validity could apply to all of its
   termination points and links as well.  This logic allows a schedule
   to represent, for example, the expected power-on state of a node at a
   specific layer.

2.3.2.  Termination Points

   When a schedule is applied to a termination point the granularity
   should at least be at the individual entity.  In cases where the
   properties of a termination point have time-variable values the model
   may define an interpolation method, either globally or per-property.

   A termination point is associated with an IP address in Layer 3
   [RFC8346] and a MAC address in Layer 2 [RFC8944] topologies.
   Schedules on a termination point could be used to indicate the
   validity of the layer-2/3 interface represented by the entity or
   changing properties of that entity.  When a schedule indicates that a
   termination point is not valid for a schedule time instant, that
   validity may apply to all of its links as well.  This logic allows a
   schedule to represent, for example, the expected power-on or
   administrative-enabled state of an attached network interface card
   (NIC) or virtual private network (VPN) endpoint.

2.3.3.  Links

   When a schedule is applied to a link the granularity should at least
   be at the individual link.  In cases where the properties of a link
   have time-variable values the model should define an interpolation
   method, either globally or per-property.

   A link is associated with link metric properties in Layer 3 [RFC8346]
   and Layer 2 [RFC8944] topologies.  Schedules on a link should be used
   to indicate the validity of the entire link or changing properties of
   that entity.  When a schedule indicates that a link is not valid for
   a schedule time instant, that validity should not apply to its
   termination points and nodes.  This logic allows a schedule to
   represent, for example, the expected connectivity state, data
   throughput/rate, and latency/delay of a link.

2.3.4.  Network Layering

   When a schedule indicates that an entity is not valid for a schedule
   time instant, that validity should not apply to any of its associated
   overlay or underlay network entities.  The effects of scheduled
   administrative disabling or enabling of an entity at one layer do not
   imply a change in administrative enabled state at any other layer.
   Likewise, the assigning of an address property at one layer does not
   imply the presence or absence of an address assignment at that same
   time instant for any other layer.

2.4.  Routing

   Traditional network routing techniques typically use link bandwidth
   and delay for path calculation, and do not consider time-based
   factors.  TVR should be capable of improving network performance and
   reliability in environments where entities liveness and link
   availability is a time-based consideration, with various factors,
   including power availability, interface line of sight or expected
   demand.

   However, even if some adjacency failures are predictable, others are
   not, including link failures and entity outages.  Therefore, any new
   technique or routing protocol extension for TVR environments must be
   capable of handling planned and unexpected resource losses.

   Time-Variant Routing (TVR) introduces a scenario of calculating a
   path, or sub-path within a network, taking into account the timing of
   message transmission or receipt as an integral part of the overall
   route computation.

   Furthermore, synchronization of network time across TVR-capable
   entities is critical.

   Three scenarios are currently considered when computing TVR-enabled
   paths.

2.4.1.  Centralized

   The network entities will receive the time variable information and
   traffic forwarding rules directly from a logically centralized
   source, an Orchestrator or network controller.  The time-variable
   data may then be processed locally by the entity entered into the
   scheduled routing table and specific forwarding rules applied.

   Furthermore, a centralized approach could also be used to extend
   existing tunnel and path delivery mechanisms and protocols to
   distribute traffic forwarding rules along with time-variable
   information.  However, in certain environments, a logically
   centralized source may lose connectivity with network entities (as
   described in Section 2.1.3), preventing timely delivery of traffic
   forwarding rules.  To mitigate this risk, the time horizon for time-
   variable information should be extended accordingly.

2.4.2.  Distributed

   Network entities may participate in a routing scheme where time
   variable information is propagated through the network via capability
   and variability advertisements.  This could be achieved using
   extensions to existing routing schemes and techniques so that link,
   adjacency, cost, and schedule may be considered when making
   forwarding decisions for per-hop packets or calculating traffic
   engineered end-to-end paths.  It should be noted that schedule
   distribution and entity computation latency may exist in some network
   environments.

   In some environments, scheduling information may distributed through
   a management plane mechanism, such as NETCONF [RFC6241] or gNMI (gRPC
   Network Management Interface) [gNMI], instead of the routing scheme.

2.4.3.  Hybrid

   In this scenario, mixed-entity TVR capability exists.  Some entities
   will require a schedule provided by a centralized source, and others
   will be capable of advertising and learning scheduled information via
   a distributed mechanism.

   This scenario presents time and schedule synchronization and source
   verification challenges and will require further study, but are out
   of scope for this document.

2.4.4.  Constraints

   Time-variant network constraints may be based on dynamic factors that
   will influence how the network is managed and how network resources
   are scheduled.  These constraints are influenced by real-time data
   and can vary significantly depending on multiple factors.  By
   considering time-variant constraints, network operators can enhance
   the efficiency, reliability, and performance of telecom networks.
   The main factors influencing these constraints include:

   1.  Predicted Traffic Demand: Network usage patterns fluctuate
       throughout the day, with peak times typically occurring during
       business hours and in the evening.  Predicting these patterns
       accurately allows for proactive resource allocation, ensuring
       that sufficient bandwidth is available during high-demand periods
       without over-provisioning during low-demand times.

   2.  Energy Efficiency: The energy consumption of network equipment
       can be optimized based on the current load.  By scheduling
       resources and adjusting power levels or shutting down
       underutilized equipment, telecom networks can significantly
       reduce energy costs and carbon footprints, contributing to
       sustainability goals.

   3.  Weather Conditions: Weather can impact network performance,
       especially for wireless and satellite communications.  Adverse
       weather conditions such as heavy rain, snow, or extreme
       temperatures can degrade signal quality.  Incorporating predicted
       and real-time weather data into network management strategies can
       help in adjusting transmission power, rerouting traffic, or pre-
       emptively switching to more resilient pathways.

   4.  Network Maintenance and Upgrades: Scheduled maintenance or
       unexpected faults can introduce temporary constraints.  By
       planning maintenance activities during off-peak hours and having
       real-time monitoring systems to quickly detect and address
       faults, network downtime can be minimized.

2.5.  Integrity Considerations

   Time-variant network relies on accurate and timely dissemination of
   time-variant routing and forwarding information.  However, the
   presence of malicious or unintended divergent information introduces
   risks that can impact network stability and operational correctness.
   An adversary could manipulate scheduled routing updates to introduce
   black holes, persistent loops, or denial-of-service conditions by
   injecting false time-sensitive state changes.  Even in non-malicious
   scenarios, incorrect or misaligned scheduling or misconfiguration, or
   time desynchronization, may lead to unintended forwarding behavior,
   potentially degrading performance or causing service disruptions.

   To mitigate these risks, TVR solution mechanisms should incorporate
   integrity validation and trust enforcement to ensure the correctness
   and authenticity of time-sensitive routing updates.  This may include
   cryptographic techniques to verify the source and integrity of
   schedule updates, consistency checks against expected network state,
   and mechanisms to detect and reject anomalous scheduling data.
   Additionally, fallback strategies should be considered to allow
   continued operation in cases where unexpected or inconsistent
   information is detected.

   Specific security considerations are discussed in the Section 5.
   later in this document.

3.  Time-Variant Use Case Requirements

   Several TVR use cases have been identified and discussed in
   [RFC9657].  This section provides further detail on specific
   requirements to meet use case needs.

3.1.  Operating Efficiency Use Case

   Several operational efficiency requirements exist; these include:

   1.  Distribution of Predicted Topology-change.  The predicted
       topology-change information may include the valid time, invalid
       time, link costs at different times, and change periods.

   2.  Topology Changes.  The predicted topology-change information may
       change due to forecasted or unforecasted changes.  The managing
       entity should be capable of providing a partial or full topology
       update as often as needed.

   3.  The Minimum Route Recalculation Interval and Threshold.  Although
       some cases may assume that the cost persists for a sufficient
       amount of time, considering that each route contains multiple
       links, the change frequency of the path may be much higher than
       the cost.  In this case, the minimum recalculation interval or
       cost change threshold is needed to determine when a route
       recalculation is required.  Of course, scheduled topology
       connection changes must be considered when path calculation is
       required.

4.  Requirements Summary

4.1.  Support the Identification and Advertisement of Entity Property
      Changes

   In Time-Variant Routing, scheduling of available entity resources is
   expected.  In practical situations, however, the properties of
   entities can be converted back and forth between Time-Variant and
   Non-Time-Variant nodes.

   An entity must support the identification and advertisement of non-
   scheduled property changes.

   Besides, if there are abnormal changes in the system, it is necessary
   to advertise them through the existing routing protocols in time to
   achieve the stability of Time-Variant Routing and avoid redundant
   advertisements.  For example, an entity in the system is suddenly
   damaged due to external factors.  Changes in entity state outside of
   a schedule are communicated to other entities in a network through
   existing routing protocol mechanism, where they exist.

   A manager should provide an advertisement methodology for responding
   to abnormal changes in the system.

4.2.  Support Proxy Advertisement

   Proxies can help to improve the efficiency of the network.  There are
   some entities in the network that do not have routing functions.
   When their properties change, they are unable to notify other
   entities in the network.  Proxy nodes can help nodes without routing
   functions to advertise information, thus improving the efficiency of
   the network.  Therefore,

   o Must support proxy entities to help non-routing nodes implement
   information advertisement.

4.3.  Support Identification and Classification of Node Properties

   The entity properties of the network may change as described in 3.1.
   If the system cannot timely identify and classify in a processing
   manner after the entity properties change, it will lead to suboptimal
   routing decisions.  Therefore,

   o Must provide a discovery and resolving methodology for the
   identification and classification of entity schedule changes.

4.4.  Support System Schedule and Time Interval Changes

   The system's schedule may change, requiring entity configuration
   updates rather than being fixed and unmodifiable.  Additionally,
   time-variant intervals in the system may also vary.  Therefore,

   o Must support system schedule changes.

   o Must support time interval changes.

4.5.  Support Appropriate Time Accuracy

   The accuracy of the time cannot be too large or too small; otherwise,
   convergence may not be possible.  Therefore,

   o Must support appropriate time tolerance.

4.6.  Support Robust Security

   Implementations must address security risks associated with time-
   variant information to ensure the reliability and integrity of
   scheduled network operations.  The following security-related
   requirements should be considered,

   o Integrity Protection: Mechanisms must be in place to ensure that
   time-sensitive routing updates are protected from unauthorized
   modification.

   o Authentication and Authorization: Entities generating or modifying
   TVR schedules must be authenticated, and only authorized entities
   should be permitted to inject, update, or override scheduled routing
   information.

   o Resilience Against Malicious or Erroneous Inputs: a TVR network
   must be resilient against the injection of incorrect or maliciously
   crafted scheduling information.

   o Time Synchronization Robustness: Since TVR relies on time-sensitive
   operations, it must ensure the trustworthiness of external time
   sources.  Protection against time-based attacks, such as replay
   attacks or clock manipulation, should also be considered.

   o Rollback and Recovery: In the event of conflicting, missing, or
   compromised time-variant routing data, TVR implementations should
   include fallback mechanisms to maintain network stability.

   By integrating these security requirements into TVR implementations,
   networks can mitigate risks associated with malicious actors,
   misconfigurations, or unintended disruptions, ensuring the robustness
   of time-sensitive routing decisions.  Specific security scenarios and
   negation and mitigation methods are discussed in Section 5.

5.  Security Considerations

   Using time-variant mechanisms introduces unique security
   vulnerabilities that must be carefully considered to ensure the
   integrity, availability, and confidentiality of the network.
   Networks relying on time-sensitive data for forwarding decisions are
   particularly susceptible to attacks that exploit temporal aspects and
   timing dependencies.

   The following potential security considerations warrant detailed
   investigation as solutions are developed and deployed.

5.1.  Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attack

   Precisely coordinating time information across devices and routers is
   critical to maintaining network stability.  Malicious actors could
   exploit this dependency by disrupting or manipulating the time
   synchronization process.  For example, an attacker could
   intentionally delay or corrupt time signals exchanged within the
   network, leading to routing errors and widespread denial-of-service
   (DoS) attacks.  In this scenario, routers and managed devices may
   fail to correctly determine the optimal paths, resulting in dropped
   packets, increased latency, or even complete service outages.
   Additionally, these attacks could be scaled to affect multiple
   devices simultaneously, further amplifying their impact.  Given the
   critical nature of time in such networks, securing time
   synchronization mechanisms, such as Network Time Protocol (NTP) or
   Precision Time Protocol (PTP), is essential to mitigate these risks.

5.2.  Traffic Analysis and Path Prediction

   Time variant networks may involve frequent updates and adjustments to
   routing tables based on current and forecasted network conditions.
   If time information is not adequately protected, attackers could
   conduct traffic analysis to infer routing decisions, network load, or
   usage patterns.  The schedule ability could enable attackers to
   launch highly targeted attacks, such as selectively overloading
   certain links or intercepting sensitive communications.  Moreover,
   long-term analysis of time-variant network data could provide
   attackers with insights into the underlying structure of the network,
   enabling them to plan more sophisticated attacks.  To counter these
   threats, it is vital to encrypt time-sensitive data and limit the
   exposure of time-related metadata to unauthorized entities.

5.3.  Activity Identification and Privacy

   In certain scenarios, precise time information exchanged within the
   network could be correlated with specific user or device behavior,
   inadvertently revealing private information.  For instance, time
   scheduling decisions could be analyzed to determine when and where
   certain devices are active, allowing an attacker to infer user
   habits, locations, or preferences.  This could pose significant
   privacy concerns, particularly in environments where sensitive
   personal or organizational data is transmitted.  Furthermore,
   attackers could use this information to create detailed profiles of
   network users, which could be exploited for social engineering
   attacks, surveillance, or other malicious activities.

5.4.  Spoofing and Manipulation of Time Information

   The accuracy and integrity of time information are crucial for making
   correct routing decisions.  If an attacker were to inject false or
   manipulated time data into the network, it could cause routers and
   devices to make incorrect decisions, potentially leading to traffic
   misrouting, network partitions, or inefficient use of resources.
   Such spoofing attacks could divert traffic through malicious nodes,
   enabling man-in-the-middle attacks, data interception, or
   unauthorized access to network resources.  Furthermore, time
   manipulation could create persistent disruptions by continuously
   altering the perceived time, thereby forcing the network into a
   constant state of flux and instability.  Robust authentication
   mechanisms for time sources and integrity checks on time-related
   messages are essential to defend against these types of attacks.
   Moreover, implementing redundancy in time synchronization (e.g.,
   multiple time sources) can provide resilience against single points
   of failure.

5.5.  Replay Attacks on Time-Sensitive Data

   Replay Attacks on Time-Sensitive Data: Time variant network data and
   schedule updates may be susceptible to replay attacks, where a
   malicious actor intercepts and retransmits valid time-based data at a
   later time.  This could cause network devices to act on outdated
   information, leading to inconsistent routing decisions, misaligned
   schedules, or security gaps.  In particular, attackers could exploit
   replay attacks to force devices into outdated configurations or
   interfere with the synchronization of schedules across the network.
   To prevent this type of attack, it is important to use a messaging
   protocol for time-variant schedules that mitigates such attacks while
   ensuring the validity and timeliness of received information.

5.6.  Compromised Time Sources

   Compromised Time Sources: The reliance on external time sources for
   synchronization purposes presents a potential attack surface for
   time-variant networks.  If a trusted time source, such as a GPS
   signal or an NTP server, is compromised, the attacker could feed
   erroneous time information to the entire network, disrupting its
   operation.  Such an attack could lead to cascading failures as
   devices attempt to synchronize with the compromised source,
   ultimately resulting in incorrect routing decisions or even the
   collapse of the network.  To address this, network operators should
   implement multiple, redundant time sources and regularly verify the
   integrity of these sources.  In addition, alerting mechanisms should
   be in place to detect significant deviations in time data that could
   indicate an attack.
