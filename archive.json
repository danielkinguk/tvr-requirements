Distribution of predicted topology-change information.\r\nIn the Operating Efficiency case, the predicted topology-change information may include the valid time, invalid time, link costs at different time, and change periods (optional).\r\n\r\nWhen distributing these predicted change information, it is required to consider the combination of different type of information, such as the combination of periodic information and non-periodic information.\r\n\r\n2). Function of adding, deleting, and modifying.\r\n\r\nIn the Operating Efficiency case, the predicted topology-change information may change frequently. For example, the tidal network may have different change regularities in different seasons. The cost of the cellular network may also change as the electricity price changes. Therefore, the predicted topology-change information that has been distributed is required to support adding, modifying, and deleting operations. There are two ways to realize this function:\r\n\r\n  a) Fully updated: it means the predicted topology-change information is fully replaced each time the generator distributes it.\r\n  b) Maintain a key for each predicted topology-change information: in this way, a generator of each predicted topology-change information generates a key for the prediction information, and uniquely identifies the information to be added, deleted, or modified by the key.\r\n\r\n3). The minimum route recalculation interval and threshold.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Operating Efficiency case assumes that the cost persists for a sufficient amount of time, considering that each route contains multiple links, the change frequency of the route may be much higher than the cost. In this case, the minimum recalculation interval or cost change threshold is needed to determine when a route recalculation is needed. Of course, topology connection changes must be considered in route calculation in advance.\r\n<<\r\n",

      "body": "Received via TVR list: \r\n\r\n[WG chair hat: OFF]\r\nHi Authors,\r\nThank you for your work on the requirements document. I have a few comments.\r\n\r\nSubstantive comments:\r\n\r\n1) Given that this is an informational document and that you\u2019ve invoked RFC 2119/8174, I\u2019m a bit confused by your use of normative verbs. I think that you\u2019re trying to express requirements for the solutions. We normally use the normative verbs to express requirements on the solutions, in documents that are on the standards track.\r\n\r\nI would suggest that you consider dropping the normative verbs and explicitly list requirements on a solution.\r\n\r\n2) Section 3.4.2. Even if path computation is distributed, that does NOT imply that scheduling must be (or should be) distributed by the routing protocol. It could instead be distributed through a management plane mechanism, such as NETCONF or gnmi.\r\n\r\n3) Section 4.1. Will other per-use-case requirements be forthcoming? If not, perhaps this could be generalized.  Requirement 3 seems unclear. Perhaps more text that would explain the context a bit more might be helpful.\r\n\r\n4) Section 8.1. You write: \"In Time-Variant Routing, scheduling of the system are as expected.\u201d  Could you please expound a bit?  That sentence seems very vague.\r\n\r\n5) Section 8.2. Please consider using the term \u2018proxy\u2019.\r\n\r\n6) Section 8.3.  You write: \"If the system cannot timely identify and classify in a processing\r\nmanner after the entity properties change, \u2026\u201d. Please clarify, I\u2019m not able to parse this. You\u2019ve described a requirement here that is \"discovery and resolving methodology for the identification and classification of entity properties\u201d. I don\u2019t understand this. Aren\u2019t the properties part of the schedule?\r\n\r\n7) Section 8.4. You write: \u201c\u2026 requiring of to be reconfigured \u2026\u201d.  I can\u2019t parse this, please reword.  Aren\u2019t time interval changes a subset of schedule changes?\r\n\r\n8) Section 8.5.  Accuracy is not an absolute value. In the real world, everything is necessarily inaccurate at some level. Normally this is described as a tolerance. What are you really asking for?\r\n\r\n Editorial comments:\r\n\r\n1) Section 3.4. You use the word \u2018livelyness\u2019.  I think you want \u2018liveness\u2019. s/computating/computing/\r\n\r\n2) Section 3.4.1. s/a Orchestrator/an Orchestrator/. s/entuty/entity. Note that the usual term for this case is a Path Computation Element (PCE).\r\n\r\n3) Section 6. By convention, the security considerations section is at the end of the document, typically right in front of IANA considerations.\r\n\r\n4) Section 8.1. s/A entity/An entity/. s/If/if/ s/a advertisement/an advertisement/\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nTony",

This could impact the network's ability to function properly and deliver services to entities.\r\n\r\nTraffic analysis and route prediction: Predicting network activity: By analyzing the shared time information, attackers could potentially predict network activity patterns and routing decisions. This information could be used to launch targeted attacks or plan disruptions.\r\n\r\nIdentifying user activity: In some scenarios, precise time information might be linked to specific user or device activity or network usage patterns. This could raise privacy concerns if not properly anonymized or protected.\r\n\r\nSpoofing and manipulation: Fake or manipulated time information could be injected into the network, leading to incorrect routing decisions and disruptions.

In consequence, multi-domain scenarios are out of scope.    \r\n\r\n* The TVR changes are not due to random mobility events of end-users or nodes. While TVR considers scenarios where topological changes occur motivated by a mobility pattern (as in the case of non-terrestrial networks, where the mobiity pattern can be predicted anf follows a clear pattern), generic random mobility events are not considerd as part of the scope of this document. \r\n\r\n* The potential implications of topological changes on the addressing of nodes is considered out of scope for the requirements analysis. \r\n\r\n8< -- \r\n\r\nPlease, note the following:\r\n- The TVR charter states: \"For example, in networks with mobile nodes, such as aerial vehicles and some orbiting spacecraft constellations, links can be lost and re-established, or neighbors may change as a function of their mobility. \" So probably we need to reconsider the mobility part, taking it as part of the scope as well. As you can see I refer to \"random\" mobility events instead of predictable patterns, but not sure if that can overcome the charter text.\r\n- Should I add the text on the XML file? Maybe we could ocnsider to migrate to markdown. Anyway, the xml file seems to be old. What is the exact file for creating the pull request?",

This data serves as the foundational information from which the system generates schedules for network resource scheduling. The nature and structure of source data may vary depending on the specific application of the scheduling system, but it typically includes the following elements:\r\n\r\n- Resource Availability: Information about the availability of the resources to be scheduled. \r\n- Resource Constraints: Constraints related to schedule resources.\r\n- Resource Details: Required resources, dependencies, and any specific requirements.\r\n- Time Constraints: Restrictions related to time.",
