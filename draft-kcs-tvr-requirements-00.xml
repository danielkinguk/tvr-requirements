      <t>Time-Variant Routing (TVR) refers to the calculation of a path or subpath through a network where the time of message transmission (or receipt) is part of the overall route computation. This means that, all things being equal, a TVR computation might produce different results depending on the time that the computation is performed without other detectable changes to the network topology or other cost functions associated with the route.</t>
      <t>This document introduces requirements where TVR computations could improve message exchange in a network.</t>

    <section anchor="overview">
      <name>Overview of Time-Variant Networks</name>
      <t>Existing Internet routing techniques maintain end-to-end connected paths across a network. Routing mechanisms exist to recover 
         connectivity and resume normal traffic forwarding as the topology changes. Occasionally, optimisation of routes may also be 
         requested, especially post-topology changes due to disruptive events. However, there are a growing number of use cases where
         changes to the routing topology are an expected part of network operations. In these scenarios, the pre-planned loss and 
         restoration of an adjacency, or formation of an alternate adjacency, should be seen as a non-disruptive event.</t>
         
      <t>Time-Variant Routing (TVR) refers to calculating a path or subpath through a network where the time of message transmission
         (or receipt) is part of the overall route computation.  Therefore, a TVR computation might produce different results 
         depending on the time that the calculation is performed without other detectable changes to the network topology or other 
         cost functions associated with the route.</t>   
         
       <section anchor="scheduling">
        <name>Resource Scheduling</name>
        <t>Planned resource scheduling will be required for various scenarios; these include networks with mobile nodes, such as 
           crewless aerial vehicles and orbiting satellite constellations. In these scenarios, links are lost and re-established 
           as a function of the mobility of the platforms. Furthermore, link activity might be restricted to certain times of the 
           day in networks without reliable access to power, such as networks harvesting energy from tidal, wind, and solar 
           resources. Similarly, network traffic might be planned around energy costs or expected user data volumes in networks 
           prioritising green computing and energy efficiency over data rate.</t>

      <section anchor="routing">
        <name>Routing</name>
        <t>Existing routing techniques are not typically designed to handle potential connectivity, i.e., nodes and links 
           scheduled to appear in the future. Therefore, the TVR Scenarios and use cases referenced and discussed in this
           document will be compromised of scheduled resources that are expected to appear in the future.</t>
        <t>However, even if some adjacency failures are predictable, others are not, including link failures and node outages.
           Therefore, any new technique or routing protocol extension for TVR enviroments must be capable of handling planned and unexpected 
           resource losses.</t>
